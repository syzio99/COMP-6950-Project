# Project Title:  Exploring Trends and Extremes in Urban Air Quality

## Project Description
This project aims to analyze and visualize urban air quality trends in a specific Indian city, focusing on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on air quality. The project involves retrieving air quality data, creating meaningful visualizations, and conducting statistical analyses to identify trends and extreme events in air quality.

## Objectives
1. Analyze urban air quality data for a specific location, focusing on pollutants such as PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, CO, and O3.
2. Create informative visualizations of air quality trends, highlighting changes before, during, and after COVID-19 lockdowns.
3. Identify and analyze extreme air quality events, defined as days where pollutant levels exceed national air quality standards or days with significant changes coinciding with lockdown measures.
4. Explore factors influencing air quality trends, such as changes in traffic volume, industrial activity, and meteorological conditions.
5. Present findings in a comprehensive project report

## Data
Dataset Source: The data will be sourced from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) via their official website: CPCB Data Portal. This source provides comprehensive air quality data, including measurements of various pollutants and real-time monitoring.

## Project Significance
This project addresses the critical issue of urban air quality and its impact on public health and the environment. By analyzing trends and extreme events, we can contribute to a better understanding of air quality dynamics, leading to informed decisions and policies for improving air quality in urban areas.
