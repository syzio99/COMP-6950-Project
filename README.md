# Impact of COVID-19 Lockdowns on Urban Air Quality: An Exploratory Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on exploring and visualising the effects of COVID-19 lockdowns on urban air quality, specifically in an Indian city. The project involves data retrieval, the creation of insightful visualizations, and conducting statistical analyses to identify air quality trends and extreme events.

## Objectives
1. **Urban Air Quality Analysis**: Analyze pollutants such as PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, CO, and O3. Investigate trends and patterns, especially in relation to the COVID-19 lockdown periods.
2. **Data Visualization**: Generate informative visualizations of air quality trends, emphasizing changes before, during, and after COVID-19 lockdowns.
3. **Extreme Event Identification**: Define "extreme events" and pinpoint when these occurred. Days, where pollutant levels exceeded certain thresholds, could be considered as extreme events.
4. **Statistical Analysis**: Conduct statistical tests to ascertain whether the differences in air quality before, during, and after the lockdowns are statistically significant.
5. **Pollution Source Identification**: Utilize the data to infer potential pollution sources, such as industrial activities and vehicular emissions, and their contribution to air quality.
6. **Findings Interpretation and Communication**: Clearly present and interpret the findings. Discuss the implications of the results for public health and urban planning.

## Data Source
The data will be sourced from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) via their official website: [CPCB Data Portal](https://cpcb.nic.in/). This source provides comprehensive air quality data, including measurements of various pollutants and real-time monitoring.

## Project Significance
This project addresses the critical issue of urban air quality and its impact on public health and the environment. By analyzing the impact of COVID-19 lockdowns on air quality, we can gain insights into the potential benefits of reducing human activities and emissions. These findings could inform future policies and strategies for improving air quality and public health in urban areas, and provide insights into the major contributors to air pollution.
